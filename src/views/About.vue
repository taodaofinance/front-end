    <h2 class="mb-4">About Mimir</h2>
    <p class="mb-4 ta-l">Mimir Solutions is a DAO funding the development and aiding in the management of defi protocols, defi security tools, and general decentralized technologies. The board of Mimir Solutions will consist of vested partners seeking to promote decentralized tech, and project leaders that have successfully completed the Mimir Solutions incubator process.</p>
    <p class="mb-4 ta-l">Assets held by Mimir Solutions will be spent as directed by proposals voted on by holders of the token $MIM.The intention is to spend these assets to fund the development of other defi protocols and development tools with the goal of improving the security and value of those protocols and tools.</p>
    <p class="mb-4 ta-l">The public governance token $MIMIR will be used to get community input on how to spend the community fund. These funds will be held in a stash provided by Squirrel. The advantage is that Squirrel Stashes provide an approved list of recipients. This way the community can ensure the funds devoted to a proposal goes to the fund managed by the board to execute on the proposal. This model also ensures that community proposals receive proper business and legal review to ensure the viability of the proposal.</p>
    <p class="mb-4 ta-l">Funds and projects supported and managed by Mimir Solutions will also be reviewed and proposed for insurance coverage through protocols like Nexo, and COVER. This way all DAO and community funds will be safe guarded against technical error, or malfeasance from project leaders.</p>
    <p class="mb-4 ta-l">Mimir solutions will ensure the expenditure of these assets to fund future development through the acquisition of the assets offered by supported protocols. Holders of MIM may vote on trading $MIM for other assets, including those held by Mimir Solutions. Including offering a sale of those assets to $MIMIR holders. This will allow for Mimir Solutions to regain a portion of the limited supply of $MIM for future use. And offer value to holders of $MIMIR in a regulatory compliant manner that differentiates itself from traditional dividend or revenue sharing models. These features are provided through partnerships with several organizations. The initial Mimir Solutions partners and their proposed partnership offering is listed below.</p>

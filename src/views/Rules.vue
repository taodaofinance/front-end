    <h1 class="mb-4">$RULES / $REGULA</h1>
    <p class="mb-6 ta-l">Due to the gas limit in Ethereum, and similar transaction fee models like the dev pays model in EOS there is a upper limit on the complexity of data processing possible on-chain. Combined with the limitations of data available on-chain there is a soft limit on the capabilities of blockchain based distributed computing.
<br><br>
Services like Chainlink and Umbrella Network providing oracles can mitigate this limit by making off-chain data available on-chain. But even with all the data in the world available on-chain, there is still a limit on the amount and complexity of calculations that can be completed in the transaction limit and time allowed to complete a block. There could be solutions in multi-tiered blockchains and process chunking across blocks, we don’t have that yet. But, what if we could move some of the complex processes off-chain?
<br><br>
Rules engines have been used for years in enterprise across business sectors to execute complex condition data processing. They are often included on broader business process management products. Just as loan underwriting, credit evaluation, fraud detection, and market analysis. And many rules engines are designed to work by accepting HTTP requests containing the “facts” being submitted for evaluation. By enriching that data rules engines can provide near-real time complex data processing so long as the query can be broken down to conditional statements. And when combined with oracle networks can easily provide this functionality on-chain.
<br><br>
$RULES is planned to follow a pay-per-request model, likely in the fractions of a cent in $RULES. This provides a real revenue model by requiring users to buy $RULES from the market to be able to use the service. When coupled with regular OTC sales of $RULES to established customers, and regular sales and buy back cycles to acquire and redistribute the supply a tokenized economy can be established. Which will enable a community marketplace of rules that users can use in their requests, with a portion of the fee going to the writers of those rules.
<br><br>
$REGULA acts as the governance token to advise on technological development to decentralize the rules engine technology, and integration with supporting technologies like Chainlink and Umbrella Network, including buy-back and sales rounds to manage project funding.
